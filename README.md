iOS-Music-Visualizer
====================

A sample music player that visualizes the beats.  For the tutorial, see here: http://www.raywenderlich.com/36475/how-to-make-a-music-visualizer-in-ios

The starter project begins with a basic music player/selector:

When all is said and done, we will hopefully have a fully functioning music player that uses particles to visualize
the beat of the song:

My end goal here is to learn the ins and outs of playing music with AVFoundation (which can be paired with SpriteKit) to allow
some music-based games which utalize the music levels/beats of a song.
